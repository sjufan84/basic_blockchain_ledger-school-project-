# Basic Blockchain Ledger
creating a simple, verifiable blockchain ledger with a ui generated by Streamlit
## Technologies

In this project we are utilizing Python 3 and Streamlit
Streamlit -- Open source framework to convert python scripts into shareable web apps
## Installation Guide

* Streamlit -- install via Pypi --  
 `pip install streamlit` in the command line
## Usage

In order to test the functionality of this project, the process is very straight forward.  Simply navigate to the root directory in the command line and then type `streamlit run pychain.py`.  This will spin up the script and launch the streamlit app in your browser.
